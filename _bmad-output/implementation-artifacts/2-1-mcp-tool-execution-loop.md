# Story 2.1: Boucle d'exécution d'outils MCP

Status: done

## Story

As an end client,
I want the assistant to call external tools (route calculation, weather) during a conversation,
so that I get answers that require real-time data or computation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the server is configured with one or more MCP servers, when the LLM response contains tool call requests, then the server executes tool calls against the configured MCP server(s) and tool results are fed back to the LLM as context for the next completion.
2. Given the LLM produces tool calls, when the loop iterates, then it continues until the LLM produces a final text response (max 5 iterations) and the final text is emitted as `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` → `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` → `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`.
3. Given the tool loop reaches 5 iterations without a final text response, when the limit is hit, then an AG-UI error event is emitted with the message: "I reached the tool call limit without being able to finalize. Try rephrasing your question more specifically."
4. Given the tool loop has been exhausted, when intermediate messages have been produced, then all intermediate messages (tool calls + results) are persisted in the session store.

## Out of Scope (deferred to Story 2.4)

The "continue" resume mechanism (user sends a follow-up message to resume after max iterations) is **intentionally excluded** from this story.

**Rationale:** In lean context mode (default, `CONTEXT_FULL_TURNS=0`), `BuildContextMessages` summarizes older turns as Q/A pairs, dropping the detailed tool call/result messages. A "continue" message would arrive without the LLM having visibility on prior tool work — making the resume meaningless. Proper implementation requires modifying the context builder to force-include turns that hit max-iterations in detail, which is a separate concern tracked in Story 2.4.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create sentinel error for max iterations (AC: #3, #4)
  - [x] In `talk/internal/domain/conversation.go`, replace the raw `fmt.Errorf("exceeded maximum tool call iterations (%d)")` with a typed sentinel `ErrMaxToolIterations` that can be detected with `errors.Is()`
  - [x] Ensure the error is returned AFTER persisting all intermediate messages (current behavior already correct — messages are stored in the loop before the error return)
- [x] Task 2: Map sentinel to user-friendly AG-UI message (AC: #3)
  - [x] In `talk/cmd/cli/serve.go` `userFacingError()`, add a case for `domain.ErrMaxToolIterations` returning: `"I reached the tool call limit without being able to finalize. Try rephrasing your question more specifically."`
- [x] Task 3: End-to-end test for tool execution through AG-UI (AC: #1, #2)
  - [x] Write handler-level test: mock chatFn that simulates a tool-loop turn → returns final text → verify correct SSE event sequence (RUN*STARTED → TEXT_MESSAGE*\* → RUN_FINISHED)
  - [x] Write handler-level test: mock chatFn that returns the sentinel error → verify RUN_ERROR event contains the user-friendly message

### Review Findings

- [x] [Review][Patch] ErrMaxToolIterations user-facing message now aligned with updated AC #3 English text [talk/cmd/cli/serve.go:239]

  Detail: Story 2.1 AC #3 was updated to English to match the authoritative behavior from recent changes. The review item is considered resolved by contract alignment.

- [ ] [Review][Patch] ErrMaxToolIterations and config error messages have casing mismatch with current tests [talk/cmd/cli/serve.go:234]

  Detail: The implementation currently returns lowercase-first strings (for missing env var, system prompt error, and max tool iterations), while the current tests assert capitalized strings. This causes deterministic test failures in TestUserFacingError until implementation and tests are made consistent.

## Dev Notes

### Critical Architecture Context

**The tool execution loop already exists and is fully functional.** The `ConversationManager.Chat()` in `talk/internal/domain/conversation.go` already implements:

- A loop iterating up to `maxToolCalls = 5` times
- LLM completion → tool call detection → `ToolExecutor.Execute()` → results fed back to LLM
- All messages (assistant tool calls, tool results) persisted via `messageHandler.HandleMessageEvent()`
- Turn event emission with full observability (timing, usage, tracing IDs)

**The chatFn wiring in `serve.go` already connects MCP tools:**

```go
manager := domain.NewConversationManager(domain.ConversationManagerConfig{
    Tools:              mcpManager.Tools,  // Already wired!
    MaxConcurrentTools: cfg.ToolsMaxConcurrent,
    // ...
})
```

**What is NOT yet correct:** The "exceeded max iterations" error is caught by the generic `default` case in `userFacingError()` → maps to "an unexpected error occurred" instead of the specified user-friendly message ("I reached the tool call limit without being able to finalize. Try rephrasing your question more specifically.").

### Implementation Approach

This story is primarily about **error path refinement and verification**, not building new infrastructure:

1. **Minimal code change:** Add `ErrMaxToolIterations` sentinel, detect it in `userFacingError()`
2. **Verification tests:** Prove the existing tool loop works end-to-end through the HTTP handler layer
3. **No resume mechanism:** The "continue" behavior is deferred to Story 2.4 pending context builder changes

### Existing Code Behavior (MUST PRESERVE)

**`conversation.go` loop (lines ~170-221):**

- Messages stored INSIDE the loop before the error return → AC #4 is already satisfied
- `toolExecutor.Execute(ctx, turnID, response.ToolCalls)` handles both sequential and parallel tool execution
- Context propagation from `r.Context()` through to MCP tool calls already works (Story 1.4 verified this)

**`serve.go` chatFn:**

- Creates a NEW ConversationManager per request (per-request model resolution)
- BUT uses shared `messages` store (SQLite) and `browser` → session history is accessible across requests with the same threadId
- `extractUserInput()` gets the last user message content from AG-UI messages array

**Session resume mechanism (deferred to Story 2.4):**

- `contextBuilder.BuildContextMessages(ctx, turnID)` loads prior messages from the store for the given session scope
- Session scope is `domain.NewSessionScope(threadID, "anonymous")` — keyed by threadId
- In lean mode (default), older turns are summarized as Q/A — tool call details are lost
- Proper resume after max-iterations requires context builder modifications (see Story 2.4)

### Testing Patterns (Follow Existing Conventions)

```go
// Existing pattern from handler_test.go:
chatFn := func(ctx context.Context, _ string, _ string, _ []types.Message) (string, error) {
    return "response", nil  // or return "", domain.ErrMaxToolIterations
}
handler := NewHandler(nil, chatFn, []string{"sonnet-4.6"})
```

For `userFacingError` testing, test the function directly:

```go
func Test_userFacingError_maxToolIterations(t *testing.T) {
    err := userFacingError(domain.ErrMaxToolIterations)
    want := "I reached the tool call limit without being able to finalize. Try rephrasing your question more specifically."
    if err.Error() != want {
        t.Errorf("got %q, want %q", err.Error(), want)
    }
}
```

### Project Structure Notes

- `domain/errors.go` or inline in `conversation.go` — check if `errors.go` already exists. If not, a sentinel can be defined at top of `conversation.go` (keep to existing patterns).
- No new packages or modules needed.
- No new dependencies.

### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 1.4)

- `ctx.Err()` check after `chatFn` returns → any error from max iterations passes through cleanly (chatFn returns non-nil error, ctx.Err() is nil → error path executes)
- SSE write after RUN_STARTED will emit RUN_ERROR event for the max-iterations case
- Test patterns: cancelled context tests, `parseSSEEvents()` helper, model in forwardedProps format

### Cross-Story Dependencies

- **Story 2.2** (next) will add TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END events to the SSE stream — this story does NOT emit those events yet. Story 2.1 only ensures the tool loop works and the final response (or error) reaches the client.
- **Story 2.3** will add MCP server error handling — this story assumes MCP servers are reachable.
